# isaac-character-template
 A quickstart to making a character for the Binding of Isaac: Repentance

## Things to note:

- All of the .anm2 files in the `content/gfx` folder MUST BE NAMED THIS WAY! You can change the .png files as long as you update the .anm2 files, but the .anm2 files must be named that for it to work.
- The code applies stat changes, costumes, and the character's creep gimmick. Use it as an example.
- Make an issue with questions.
